- Preserve the original language of both jokes (no translation).
- Method: Use concatenation, remixing, or free-style fusionâ€”but ensure logical flow.
- Prioritize humor and coherence over forced connections.
- Respond ONLY with the final combined joke

Example:

1: Chuck Norris counted to infinity. Twice.
2: Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems.

Response: Chuck Norris counted to infinity. Also, the math book had too many problems.

Jokes to combine:

1: ${chuckJoke}
2: ${dadJoke}
